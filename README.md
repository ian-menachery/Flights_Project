# Asian Flight Routes Visualization Project

## Overview

This project explores and visualizes flight route data across Asia using interactive, informative visualizations. Our goal is to uncover patterns in airline connectivity, route popularity, and geographical coverage by analyzing a dataset of global airport routes with a focus on the Asian continent.

## Dataset

We use the open-source airport routes dataset available from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html), accessed via CSV. This dataset contains information about:

- Source and destination airports  
- Airlines operating the routes  
- Number of stops (direct vs. connecting flights)  
- Airport geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude)  
- Country and city information for each airport  

## Project Goals

- Visualize the structure and density of airline routes in Asia  
- Identify major airline hubs and connectivity patterns  
- Explore differences in route density across countries and regions  
- Provide an interactive and engaging way to explore flight networks geographically  

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis  
- **Pandas**: For cleaning and structuring the data  
- **Altair**: For building interactive and declarative data visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For prototyping and development  

## Key Features

- **Interactive Route Maps**: Filter by airline, country, or number of stops  
- **Network Graphs**: Visualize hub airports and regional connectivity  
- **Custom Styling**: Maps styled to highlight Asian geography and traffic density  

## Context

This project is part of a group assignment for *DS4200: Information Presentation and Visualization* at Northeastern University. Our team is working to create compelling visuals that go beyond basic charts, using interactivity and storytelling to bring aviation data to life.

## Project Team

- Ian Menachery  
- Will Hanvey  
- Janet Lim  

## Future Plans

- Add time-based filtering to show route expansions/contractions  
- Compare pre- and post-COVID airline connectivity  
- Integrate external data (e.g., passenger volume or airline revenue)
