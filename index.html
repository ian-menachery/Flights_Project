        <h1>introduction:</h1>
    <p>Our topic is related to flight route data. In other words, from a specific airport, we have data on the specific airport 
        in addition to where you can fly directly to from that airport. From flight route data, we can gather a lot of information 
        about the broader world- for example, we can see passenger travel trends, learn what countries have strong relations denoted by 
        many flights between them, and see what countries may be the most connected to and the most isolated from the outside world. Aviation route data like 
        this can tell us so much about geopolitical trends in our world, and is of great interest to all of us in the group.

        <h1>Dataset:</h1>
    <p>The data provides a global perspective on air travel, which gives us the opportunity to analyze the patterns between countries 
        and their air travel routes. Identifying flight frequency patterns and airline hubs can reveal insights about economic activity, 
        geopolitical issues, and global tourism. As for missing information, we donâ€™t have data on pricing or the size of the aircraft 
        flying the routes, so a route with a small propeller plane would be treated the same as a route with an Airbus A380. 
        These are some possible limitations for our analysis, but we feel our website will still be interesting and educational even without those data points.
