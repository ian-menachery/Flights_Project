                            <p>This flight route selector lets you choose two countries from the list of China, Hong Kong, India, 
                                Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan and let you see all the flight connections between them. You can 
                                also view domestic flights (with the exception of China, as the file is too large and cannot be 
                                displayed in Python) for each country. This allows for a lot of interesting insights to be drawn. 
                                For example, Japan and Hong Kong share plenty of links for tourism and business, and that can be 
                                seen by how you can fly directly from Hong Kong to 12 airports in Japan. Pakistan is a primarily 
                                Muslim country and it only has direct connections to four airports in China- Beijing and Guangzhou, 
                                two of China’s most important cities, and Urumqi and Kashgar, which are smaller cities with a large 
                                Muslim population in the west of China. Some countries are also much more dependent on domestic 
                                flights than other countries. For example, Pakistan, a less wealthy nation that has a decently built-out 
                                road network, doesn’t have too many domestic flight routes. Indonesia, on the other hand, is an island 
                                nation, meaning flights are the easiest way to get between islands that might not have regular boat 
                                service. A lack of flights can also tell you a lot. Many people know about the geopolitical tensions 
                                between India and Pakistan, so it might not be unexpected that there are no flights between the two 
                                countries. However, due to border disputes between India and China, there are also no direct flights 
                                between the world’s two most populous countries, despite the demand being there.</p>
