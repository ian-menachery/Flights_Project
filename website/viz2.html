                            <p>This map displays all airports in Asia based on size. The airports are divided into large airports 
                                (>75 direct destinations) in blue, medium airports (>25 direct destinations) in purple, and small 
                                airports in orange. From this map, it can be very clearly seen how well-connected China’s airports 
                                are, with dozens of large and medium-sized airports in its eastern half. Its western half is much 
                                less populated and sparse, which can be seen by the lack of large airports. Other highly-populated 
                                countries, like Korea and Vietnam, have plenty of airports throughout, while countries with smaller 
                                populations and lots of empty areas, like Mongolia and Kazakhstan, similarly have a lack of airports 
                                in many parts of the country. This map also shows how important airports are to islands, with islands 
                                in countries like Indonesia and Japan’s Okinawa often containing small airports with only a few destinations 
                                that primarily serve to link the islands to the mainland.</p>
