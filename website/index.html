                            <p>Our project focuses on aviation route data, specifically direct flight connections from individual airports around the world. 
                                By analyzing where you can fly directly from a given airport, we gain valuable insight into patterns of global connectivity.
                                Flight routes are more than just paths for planes. 
                                They tell broader stories about our world. They highlight travel trends, showcase economic ties, and reflect political relationships between countries. 
                                For example, the frequency and density of routes between two nations may suggest strong diplomatic or commercial bonds, while the absence of connections can point to isolation or geopolitical tension.
                                This kind of data allows us to identify which regions are the most globally integrated and which are the most disconnected. 
                                In a world where mobility and connection are vital, flight routes serve as a powerful lens to understand international relationships, regional development, and global movement patterns.
                                Through this website, we aim to make sense of these networks. Our goal is not just to understand where planes go, but what those routes reveal about the world we live in.</p>

                            <p>We are using a dataset comprised of all current flight routes in Asia, which give us the opportunity to analyze the patterns between, 
                                and within, countries. Identifying flight frequency patterns and airline hubs can reveal insights about economic activity, geopolitical 
                                issues, and global tourism. The data we have also contains information like the airlines flying each route, the average length the route 
                                takes, and information about the airport, such as coordinates, altitude, and the city the airport is tied to and country it is located in. 
                                There are some data points we don‚Äôt have- such as data on pricing or the size of the aircraft flying the routes, so a route with a small 
                                propellor plane is treated the same by our analysis as a route with a massive Airbus A380. Despite these limitations, though, we feel 
                                we were able to create a lot of interesting visualizations and learn a lot about the world.</p>

                                Flight paths can tell us a lot about the world. They tell us where groups of people go for leisure, where their families are, where their ancestors lived, 
                                where they go for business, and places where they don‚Äôt go. By analyzing flight routes, we were able to identify geopolitical bonds between nations, such as 
                                countries like Singapore that act like a hub for a region, or, the opposite- countries like India and China, two huge countries that aren‚Äôt only the friendliest 
                                of terms. We can identify things like population density by looking at bubble maps and learn about the efficiency of the governments of different nations by 
                                looking at timeliness patterns. While our project was focused on Asia specifically, in the future, it would be beneficial to expand it to cover the entire world 
                                to get a bigger picture of these topics. Additionally, a timeline of flight routes would be useful, as we would be able to uncover things like seasonal trends or 
                                turning points in interstate relations, such as the point when China and India cut off flights or Qatar‚Äôs improving relationship with Saudi Arabia after a crisis 
                                that started in 2017. Still, though, we believe we were able to learn a lot with what data we have, and we hope to expand our project in the future.
