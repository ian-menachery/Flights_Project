                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Our topic is related to flight route data. In other words, from a specific airport, we
                                have data on
                                the specific airport
                                in addition to where you can fly directly to from that airport. From flight route data,
                                we can
                                gather a lot of information
                                about the broader world- for example, we can see passenger travel trends, learn what
                                countries have
                                strong relations denoted by
                                many flights between them, and see what countries may be the most connected to and the
                                most isolated
                                from the outside world. Aviation route data like
                                this can tell us so much about geopolitical trends in our world, and is of great
                                interest to all of
                                us in the group.</p>

                            <h2>Dataset</h2>
                            <p>The data provides a global perspective on air travel, which gives us the opportunity to
                                analyze the
                                patterns between countries
                                and their air travel routes. Identifying flight frequency patterns and airline hubs can
                                reveal
                                insights about economic activity,
                                geopolitical issues, and global tourism. As for missing information, we don‚Äôt have data
                                on pricing
                                or the size of the aircraft
                                flying the routes, so a route with a small propeller plane would be treated the same as
                                a route with
                                an Airbus A380.
                                These are some possible limitations for our analysis, but we feel our website will still
                                be
                                interesting and educational even without those data points.</p>
