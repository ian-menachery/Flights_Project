                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Our project focuses on aviation route data, specifically direct flight connections from individual airports around the world. 
                                By analyzing where you can fly directly from a given airport, we gain valuable insight into patterns of global connectivity.
                                Flight routes are more than just paths for planes. 
                                They tell broader stories about our world. They highlight travel trends, showcase economic ties, and reflect political relationships between countries. 
                                For example, the frequency and density of routes between two nations may suggest strong diplomatic or commercial bonds, while the absence of connections can point to isolation or geopolitical tension.
                                This kind of data allows us to identify which regions are the most globally integrated and which are the most disconnected. 
                                In a world where mobility and connection are vital, flight routes serve as a powerful lens to understand international relationships, regional development, and global movement patterns.
                                Through this website, we aim to make sense of these networks. Our goal is not just to understand where planes go, but what those routes reveal about the world we live in.</p>

                            <p>We are using a dataset comprised of all current flight routes in Asia, which give us the opportunity to analyze the patterns between, 
                                and within, countries. Identifying flight frequency patterns and airline hubs can reveal insights about economic activity, geopolitical 
                                issues, and global tourism. The data we have also contains information like the airlines flying each route, the average length the route 
                                takes, and information about the airport, such as coordinates, altitude, and the city the airport is tied to and country it is located in. 
                                There are some data points we don‚Äôt have- such as data on pricing or the size of the aircraft flying the routes, so a route with a small 
                                propellor plane is treated the same by our analysis as a route with a massive Airbus A380. Despite these limitations, though, we feel 
                                we were able to create a lot of interesting visualizations and learn a lot about the world.</p>

                                <br><br>This paper investigates global transportation networks with a strong emphasis on aviation connectivity. 
                                It applies complex network analysis techniques to explore the structure and dynamics of flight networks. 
                                The study identifies central nodes (airports) that serve as major hubs within the network and examines how these hubs influence overall connectivity. By analyzing direct flight connections, 
                                the paper reveals patterns in the network‚Äôs structure, such as clustering and path lengths, which in turn highlight potential vulnerabilities and strengths in global connectivity.
