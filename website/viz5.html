                            <p>This visualization lets you explore the relationship between flight distance and total travel time, filtered by the origin airport. 
                                In this context, flight time refers to the period beginning when an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight and ending when it comes to rest after landing. 
                                This includes not only time spent in the air but also taxiing on the ground, which can vary significantly between airports. 
                                While there is a general upward trend between distance and time, several airports stand out for how they deviate from expectations. 
                                DXB (Dubai), the busiest airport in Asia, performs about average for shorter flights under 3,000 kilometers but tends to outperform the trendline on longer routes. 
                                This suggests that pilots may be able to make up time in the air following delays at departure. 
                                In contrast, Chinese airports such as PVG (Shanghai), PEK (Beijing), and HGH (Hangzhou) show slower-than-expected flight times, likely due to congestion and frequent delays. 
                                Indonesia’s major airports, including CGK (Jakarta), DPS (Bali), and SUB (Surabaya), consistently beat expectations, which points to a more efficient overall operation. 
                                These patterns provide valuable insight into how airport congestion, airspace management, and regional infrastructure impact the actual experience of air travel across Asia.</p>
